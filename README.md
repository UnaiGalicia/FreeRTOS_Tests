# FreeRTOS_Tests
My tests with FreeRTOS in ESP32, following Shawn Hymel's tutorial. Many thanks to him!

##Implementation
The code that I wrote following the tutorial was written in VSCode using PlatformIO. The Arduino framework was used to implement the code in the ESP32 DevkitC V4.

Challenges were completed by myself, they of course might not be perfect.
