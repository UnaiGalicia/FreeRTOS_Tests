# FreeRTOS_Tests
My tests with FreeRTOS in ESP32, following Shawn Hymel's tutorial. Many thanks to him!

## Implementation
The code that I wrote following the tutorial was written in VSCode using PlatformIO. The Arduino framework was used to implement the code in the ESP32 DevkitC V4.

This code will be taken as a reference for the BLE project soon available in my page.

Challenges were completed by myself, they of course might not be perfect.
